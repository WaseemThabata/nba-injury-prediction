## 🎯 FAANG Interview Talking Points

### System Design
"Built a production ML system with modular architecture, following SOLID principles. Implemented clean separation between data loading, preprocessing, training, and evaluation."

### Testing
"Wrote 22 unit tests achieving 93-97% coverage on core modules. Used pytest with fixtures for consistent test data. Integrated automated testing in CI/CD pipeline."

### DevOps
"Containerized the application with Docker, set up CI/CD with GitHub Actions for multi-version Python testing, and created Makefile for automation."

### Code Quality
"Enforced PEP 8 compliance with Flake8, used Black for formatting, added type hint support with MyPy, and configured pre-commit hooks."

### ML Engineering
"Built end-to-end pipeline: data ingestion → feature engineering → model training → evaluation → deployment. Added SHAP for interpretability."

### Documentation
"Created comprehensive documentation including API docs, quick start guide, and architecture diagrams. Used badges for quick project status."
